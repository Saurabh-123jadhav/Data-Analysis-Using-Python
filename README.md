DIWALI SALES ANALYSIS - 

Excited to share insights from my latest analysis project on consumer behavior during Diwali sales! Using data from Kaggle, I analyzed sales trends and purchasing patterns in Jupyter Notebook, leveraging Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

🔍 KEY INSIGHTS:
Female buyers, especially those aged 26-35, show the highest purchasing power, with married women being particularly active buyers.
Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka topped the list for the highest order volumes and sales.
Leading sectors driving purchases include IT, Healthcare, and Aviation.
Clothing was the most ordered category, though food products generated the highest revenue.
This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply data analysis techniques and draw actionable insights from consumer data. 💡
📈 Tools used: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
📊 Skills showcased: Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Trend Analysis
Looking forward to connecting with others in data analysis or hearing your thoughts on this project!

STUDENT SCORE ANALYSIS -

I'm excited to share my latest data analysis project, where I explored various factors influencing student performance. Using data sourced from the internet, I applied data cleaning, visualization, and analysis techniques with Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
🔍 KEY INSIGHTS:
Females outperform males in overall academic performance.
Parental education plays a significant role—students with well-educated parents score higher.
Standard lunches and test preparation positively impact scores across all subjects.
Math is generally more challenging than Reading and Writing.
Ethnic group C performed the best overall.
Other factors, like sports participation, number of siblings, or transportation, had minimal influence.
This project was a great opportunity to sharpen my data analysis skills and extract actionable insights from complex datasets. 💡
